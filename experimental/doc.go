/*
Package experimental contains experimental features and components that are being trialed
before wider rollout across the codebase.

# Purpose

This package serves as a testing ground for:
- New features and functionality being evaluated
- Prototype implementations and proof-of-concepts
- APIs and interfaces that may change frequently
- Trial implementations before committing to stable interfaces

# Stability Warning

⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL CODE - USE WITH CAUTION** ⚠️

Code in this package is:
- **Not guaranteed to be stable** - interfaces may change without notice
- **Subject to frequent breaking changes** - no backward compatibility guarantees
- **May be incomplete or buggy** - features might not work as expected
- **May be removed at any time** - without deprecation warnings

Note: Experimental features are not covered by semantic versioning guarantees.
Breaking changes may occur in any release.
